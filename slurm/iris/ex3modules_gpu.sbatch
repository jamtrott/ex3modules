# This script builds and installs software packages and Environment
# Modules scripts for x86_64 systems on the Iris cluster. The build is
# performed on a node belonging to the gpu partition on Iris.
#
# The SLURM job must be submitted from the top-level directory of
# ex3modules, where the program `ex3modules' is located. The standard
# output and standard error streams are redirected to files in the
# directory slurm/iris/jobs/.
#
# Example usage:
#
#  $ sbatch slurm/iris/ex3modules_gpu.sbatch --prefix=/work/${USER}/ex3modules
#
